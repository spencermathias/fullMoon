About
^^^^^

this game occurs during the night of the full moon. the werewolves in the village have emeged... have the
 villagers prepared enough for this night to survive until morning?

Set-Up
^^^^^^

take the 2 general action cards and place them in the center of the table.

separate role action cards into 9 piles by type. then take out the village role cards. each village role card matches
one of the role action cards. (there may be more than one of each role card for each role action card). separate the 
role action cards into their respective piles. select the appropriate number of cards from each role card pile and 
create the village deck, according to the table included on the reference card.

(note) in games with less that 6 players, do not include the big bad wolf, the the cult leader, or the hunter.

(note) beginners should use the werewolf, the minion, villagers,the cursed villager, doppelgangers, the seer, the troublemaker,
masons, the hunter, and the lycan in their village set-up when appropriate.

for each  role card in the village deck, place the corresponding role action card in the center of the table with the general
action cards, face up for everyone to see. these are the only roles that will be in play for the game. together with the general
action cards, these define the only actions that can be taken during the game.

place the tokens next to the role action cards that they correspond to, for all to see.

shuffle the village deck and deal 2 to each player. the players should look at their role cards, but keep them hidden 
from the other players by placing them face down in front of them. players may not switch the places of their two cards 
once the game has begun, unless and action on a card specifically allows them to do so.

place the remaining role cards in the center of the table, face down in separate spots as the sleeping villager(s).

give each player 2 coins. put the remaining coins in the treasury.

randomly select a player to go first.

Goal
^^^^

The village team wins if all the werewolf cards have been killed before the critical number of non werewolf cards have been killed.
 the werewolf team wins if the critical number of non werewolf cards have been killed before all the werewolf cards have been killed.

Gameplay 
^^^^^^^^

The game is played in a clockwise order. Each turn a player chooses one action only. A player may not pass. 
After the action is chosen the other players have an opportunity to challenge that action. A player must allow for players to challenge their action before they may move look at or otherwise affect a card in any way. 
If an action is not challenged it automatically succeeds challenges are resolved first before any action is resolved. 

A player's lives 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Face down villager cards in front of a player represent the player's lives. The roles on their face down cards represent what actions that player can legitimately take without losing a challenge. 
Every time a player loses a life they have to turn over and reveal one of their face down cards. 
Cards revealed as a lost life remain face up in front of the player visible to everyone and no longer provide legitimate action for that player.
When both of a players cards are dead and cannot be used post death they are eliminated from play and cannot take a turn vote or contribute to the conversation but may still win the game with their team. 

Actions
^^^^^^^

The role action cards and the general action cards define the available actions a player may take in the game. 
A player may choose any action they want and can afford. 
General actions are always available and do not require a special roll card.
To choose a role action card a player simply claims that one of their cards will allow them to take the action but they do not have to specify which role they are claiming to have. For instance if a player pays four coins to attack another card they do not have to specify whether they claim to have the werewolf lone Wolf minion hoodlum lichen or village idiot they simply claim that they can take the action. 
When a player claims they can take an action, they can be telling the truth or bluffing they do not need to reveal any of their face down cards unless they are challenged if they are not challenged they automatically succeed. 
If a player starts their turn with 10 or more coins they must start a lynching that turn as their only action. 
If there are not enough coins in the middle to fully take an action the player May partially take it. 
If there are no more coins in the treasury a player may not take an action involving taking coins from the treasury. 

Roll actions 
^^^^^^^^^^^^

A quick summary of the actions available to each role is on the village roll card see relevant role action cards for full details of the action. 

Three ways to die 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Attack: when a player attacks a card they pay for or six coins and point to a specific card in front of another player that particular card must be flipped over as the lost life. The hunter may also attack a card without paying. 

Lynching: when a player is lynched a card on the werewolf team must be lost if they have one in front of them otherwise they may choose which card to lose they may also choose which card to reveal if both their cards are on the werewolf team. 

Challenges: a player can lose a challenge by being caught in a bluff or by challenging someone else who was not bluffing. In either of these cases, the player who loses the challenge may choose which of their two cards to reveal. 

Lynchings 
^^^^^^^^^

When a player plays seven coins to start a lynching all the players still in the game may talk for a moment about who they do and do not trust and why. 
 When the person who paid for the lynching feels that enough debate has happened they shout one two three on three all players must point to another player in the circle players may not point at themselves. Players may not wait to see what others votes are before they make their own vote. 
The player with most people pointing to them at them is lynched. If there is a tie the player who paid for the lynching breaks the tie and may choose either of the tide votes no matter what they originally voted. 
The player who paid for the lynching is not immune to being lynched. 
Players also choose to point at the sleeping villagers in the middle instead of at another player. A vote for the middle suggests that the rest of the werewolf cards are not alive in front of other any other players but among the cards not in play. 
A vote for the sleeping villagers only goes through if more than half of the remaining players point to the cards in the center. 
 if a vote for the sleeping villagers goes through they are all flipped over along with any Dead face down cards claiming to be hunters. If the rest of the werewolf cards are among these cards the villager team wins if not the werewolf team wins. 

Challenges 
^^^^^^^^^^

Any action excluding general actions can be challenged any player can issue a challenge to any other player regardless of whether they are involved in the action. 
Once an action is declared other players must be given an opportunity to challenge once play continues challenges cannot be retroactively issued. If a player is challenged they must prove they have the required village roll card by showing that it is one of their face down cards if they cannot or do not wish to prove it they lose the challenge if they do prove it the Challenger loses. 
Whoever loses the challenge immediately loses a life. If a player wins a challenge by showing the relevant village roll, they first placed that card with the other sleeping villagers shuffle them, draw a random replacement and place it face down in front of them that way they have not lost a life and the other players do not know the village roll card they have then the action the player would have taken is resolved a special exception to this is a challenge Mason who can take the new card before shuffling the remaining sleeping villager cards if he wishes. 
Important note losing challenges a player cannot win the game for their team if they lose a challenge to do so for instance if a player on the werewolf team cannot win the game for their team by losing a challenge and flipping over a non werewolf card in front of them if the otherwise winning kill happens in this way the team needs to kill one more appropriate card in order to win. 

Player interactions 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Players are not allowed to name the cards they have seen in front of any other player a player May point out the cards he knows the identity of and he may Express how he feels about the card but he may not name the card whether he is lying about it or not so if the seer is looking at another player's card and saw a werewolf they cannot say they have seen a werewolf they can only say they don't have a good feeling about the card and that the player has of course they may say the opposite if the player who has the sear is also on the werewolf team 

Allegiances
^^^^^^^^^^^

The goal of the game is different depending on a player's allegiance if there is a card on the werewolf team werewolf lone Wolf Big bad Wolf minion sorceress vampire hoodlum or dead cursed villager in front of a player weather face down or face up that player is on the werewolf team. This means that players allegiances can change mid-game when the cards change places on the table if a player has nowhere wolf team cards they are on the village team. 

The critical number 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The critical number of non werewolf cards is the number of players for instance in a five-player game the villager team wins if the werewolf or big bad wolf or lone Wolf is killed before 5 non werewolf cards are killed. Even though the force of evil rules are on the werewolf team they do not count as werewolf cards for instance if the minion card is in play the death of the minion counts against the villagers as it is not a werewolf that has been killed. 

Winning the game 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The villager team wins if all the werewolf cards (werewolves lone wolf and the Big bad Wolf) have been killed before the critical number of non werewolf cards are killed. The werewolf team wins is the critical number of none werewolf cards have been killed before the lone Wolf The Big bad Wolf and all the werewolf cards. 

Unique wins 
^^^^^^^^^^^

The Tanner the Tanner ones along with the villager team or he can win by himself by being killed. 

The lone Wolf the lone Wolf can win alongside the werewolf team but if there are any other werewolf cards still alive when the game ends the lone Wolf is not win with its team. 

Two-player variant 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To play with two players the game play changes in the following ways: 

* Five cards are in play a werewolf a villager a doppelganger or cult leader a seared or apprentice and a deceased 
* Players may not look at the cards they are dealt the only way a player may look at a card in play is by using either the sear or The apprentice Sears action 
* All living cards now move one spot clockwise every turn 
* The players taking the doppelganger or co-leader action may also switch their card with the sleeping villager when using the cult leader only put one Colt token in play. 
* whenever a player is challenged after taking the role action that player must choose one of the early hearts to reveal if that card defends against the challenge the player who loses a life if it does not defend the card that is flipped and lost cards flipped over as lost by start rotation with the other cards. 
* When a player pays for lunch they automatically Lynch the other player a player being lynched flips over all of their living cards if a werewolf is there the lyncher wins if not the lynched player chooses which card is the Lost life shuffles his remaining card if he has one with the sleeping village and replaces his remaining card with one of the shuffled cards. 
* After two non werewolf cards are killed all other cards are flipped over to discover who is on the werewolf team.
